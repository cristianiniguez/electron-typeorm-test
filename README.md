# Electron from Zero

Electron, TypeScript and React in a boilerplate, made from Electron Forge

## How does it work?

Like any other Electron Project, there is a main process and a renderer process:

- The main process works only with TypeScript.
- The renderer process works with Webpack and TypeScript.

## How to use this?

- Clone this repo
- Delete .git folder (if you want)
- Install dependencies (`yarn`)
- Run project (`yarn start`)

This boilerplate isn't ready yet, but if you like to check it out, go ahead and use it.
